Physician: Good afternoon. What’s been going on?

Patient: I’ve been having this weird chest pain since this morning. It started suddenly while I was getting out of bed.

Physician: Can you describe the pain?

Patient: It’s kind of a deep pain, like something tearing inside. It started in the middle of my chest, but now it’s moving towards my back.

Physician: So the pain has changed location?

Patient: Yeah, I guess so. It was mostly in the front at first, but now it’s more in my upper back, between my shoulder blades.

Physician: On a scale from 0 to 10, how bad is it?

Patient: Maybe a 7 at first, but it’s been coming and going. It feels worse when I move.

Physician: Have you felt short of breath?

Patient: A little bit, but not too bad.

Physician: Have you had any dizziness or felt like you might pass out?

Patient: Yeah, actually. When I stood up earlier, I got really lightheaded for a second.

Physician: Have you had any numbness or weakness in your arms or legs?

Patient: Now that you mention it, my right arm feels kind of weak, but I thought I just slept on it funny.

Physician: Any history of high blood pressure?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve had high blood pressure for years. I take meds, but I miss doses sometimes.

Physician: Any history of heart disease, strokes, or aneurysms in your family?

Patient: My uncle had an aneurysm in his brain, I think.

Physician: Have you ever been diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder, like Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos?

Patient: No, not that I know of.

Physician: Have you had any recent chest injuries or trauma?

Patient: No.

Physician: Any palpitations or racing heartbeat?

Patient: Yeah, my heart feels like it’s been pounding all day.

Physician: Have you had any leg swelling or pain?

Patient: No.
